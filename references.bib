However, unaccompanied migrant youth (UMY) still struggle in accessing appropriate mental health resources in spite of their high need for mental health support. Through co-design workshops, and using the lens of the social-ecological model of resilience, we explored the social-ecological factors that support or hinder UMY’s use of mental health apps as resources. We identified the strong influence of the macro-system (i.e. resettlement policies) on the bio-and micro-systems, which in turn limits participants’ abilities to use the apps. Our findings highlight the factors specific to each social-ecological system—including personal experiences, technological infrastructure and social environment—that need to be accounted for when designing technological mental health resources for UMY. This contributes: a rich description of the interplay of mental health apps with social-ecological systems in which UMY are embedded; and the corresponding design considerations.}, booktitle = {Proceedings of the 2021 CHI Conference on Human Factors in Computing Systems}, articleno = {541}, numpages = {19}, keywords = {Youth, Asylum-Seekers, Ecology, Marginalized, Mental Health, Refugees, Social-Ecological}, location = {Yokohama, Japan}, series = {CHI '21} }
